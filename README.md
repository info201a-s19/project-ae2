It sorts the schools by various audio acoustics and stacks up school in listening frequency and listening diversity. As well as showing top genres for each school and distincitive tracks and artists of each school.

https://insights.spotify.com/us/2017/02/07/spotify-accuweather-music-and-weather/
This project followed the question of whether people make different music-listening decisions based on the weather. Some findings included sunnier days brought higher-energy, happier sounding music, contrastly rainier days people tended to listen to low energy, sadder music. Seattle and Chicago are more impacted by overcast days than rainy ones, and so many more interesting findings.

For each source of data, provide the following information:

Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?

How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?

How many observations (rows) are in your data?

How many features (columns) are in the data?

What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?
